# randomingredients

There's nothing quite as creativity-inducing as strict boundaries. Generate random ingredients to use for your next meal and become a better cook!

### Rules

1. Generate two sets of 7 random ingredients. Pick one.
2. Include at least 5 of the 7 ingredients in your meal.
3. You may add other ingredients as you see fit, but the resulting dish needs to center around the random ingredients.
